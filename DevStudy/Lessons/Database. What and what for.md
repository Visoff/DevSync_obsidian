Database is the "place to store user generated data"

But why? I can do the same with just variables

Well, yes and no.
First of all, When you restart your app, your variables will disappear and database most likely not(unless someone crashes it)
Second of all. Where your data is a lot more complex and volumes are a lot bigger, variables are not the solution.
