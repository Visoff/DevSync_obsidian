DevSync provides a couple of services and the way to interact with them as with monolith system(even though it could be splited across distributed system)

We have 3 types of services:
1. [[Architect service|Architect]]
2. [[Central service]]
3. [[Logical service]]

To start using DevServices you can go into https://services.devsync.tech, create account, and start your free trial.
Alternatively, you can spin up your own services with help of docker. For that you can use the [[Self-hosted DevServices|guide]].

After you have set up your DevServies server(or self-hosted your own) we can get into configuring it. If you are using DevServices, you can use built in architecture configuration. But if you like keeping architecture in text format or you are self-hosting, you'll need to follow [[DevServices. Architecture as code|this guide]].
