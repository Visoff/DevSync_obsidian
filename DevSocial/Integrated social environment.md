DevSocial or Integrated Social Environment(developed by DevSync) is an app that will allow developers to integrate their workflow into communications services. So developers can talk about code easier then ever before. It also provides some very easy to use and extendable backend as service with microservice architecture that can be self hosted and managed with it's own architecture as code tool.
